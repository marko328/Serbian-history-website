# Serbian-history-website

Since i am a history fan, especially national history fan, i've decided to create a website about Serbian national history which can, i shortly, present
you the history of my country.

I created a progress bar by using the JavaScript, and removed so called "jumping pages" with overscroll-behavior-y tool from CSS.

Website can be modified, of cource, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to enroll :)
